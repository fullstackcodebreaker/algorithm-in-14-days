# What is algorithm

---

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem. Algorithms are often used in many real life problems. In computer science, algorithm has a special meaning. It is defined to have these features:

* Algorithm must have some data to operate on it

* It must produce at least one result

* It must terminate after finite numbers of steps

History of algorithms can be traced back to ancients Greek.

An efficient method for finding Greatest Common Divisor was proposed by** Euclid**

Systematics study of algorithm was done in 50 AD by Alkhawarizmi.

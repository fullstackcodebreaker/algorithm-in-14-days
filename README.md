Doing things 1 step or 1% at a time is a great way to improve almost anything in your life.

# Algorithm is pretty simple

Simply put, an algorithm is a series of contained steps, which you follow in order to achieve some goal, or to produce some output. Letâ€™s take for example your grandmaâ€™s recipe for baking a cake. Wait, does that count as an algorithm? Sure it does!

```javascript
function BakeCake(flavor, icing){
    /*
     1. Heat Oven to 350 F
     2. Mix flour, baking powder, salt
     3. Beat butter and sugar until fluffy
     4. Add eggs.
     5. Mix in flour, baking powder, salt
     6. Add milk and " + flavor + "
     7. Mix further
     8. Put in pan
     9. Bake for 30 minutes
    10." + if(icing === true) return 'add icing' + "
    10. Stuff your face
    */
}

BakeCake('vanilla', true) => deliciousnes
```

In the same way you can slice a pie a 100 different ways, you can solve a single problem with many different algorithms. Some solutions are just more efficient, taking less time and requiring less space than others

# Why this book?

I wrote this book because I am super frustrated with the interview process for becoming an engineer. Companies ask lots of super algorithmic questions that for most part don't really apply to your day to day work. This book wil help you to prepare for those terrible interviews.

Doing things 1 step or 1% at a time is a great way to improve almost anything in your life.

# Algorithm is dead simple

Simply put, an algorithm is a series of contained steps, which you follow in order to achieve some goal, or to produce some output. Let’s take for example your grandma’s recipe for baking a cake. Wait, does that count as an algorithm? Sure it does!

```
function BakeCake(flavor, icing){
    "
     1. Heat Oven to 350 F
     2. Mix flour, baking powder, salt
     3. Beat butter and sugar until fluffy
     4. Add eggs.
     5. Mix in flour, baking powder, salt
     6. Add milk and " + flavor + "
     7. Mix further
     8. Put in pan
     9. Bake for 30 minutes
    10." + if(icing === true) return 'add icing' + "
    10. Stuff your face
    "
}

BakeCake('vanilla', true) => deliciousness
```

In the same way you can slice a pie a 100 different ways, you can solve a single problem with many different algorithms. Some solutions are just more efficient, taking less time and requiring less space than others

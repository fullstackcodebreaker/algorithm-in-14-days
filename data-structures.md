# Data Structures

In programming courses, we all need to study data structures. Data structures are mechanisms in which data is organized in computer systems and used by computer programs. The aim of data structures is to organize data so as to use it in efficient way.

Although we can construct many complex data structures using pointers, we present only the rudimentary ones:

* Stack & Queue
* Trees & Searching 
* Tree
* Set
* Heap
* Graph
* Hash table
* Binary Search
